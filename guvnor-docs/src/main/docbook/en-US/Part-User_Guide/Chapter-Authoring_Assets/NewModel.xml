    <title>The Fact Model</title>

    <para>For any rule base application, a fact model is needed to drive the
    rules. The fact model typically overlaps with the applications domain
    model, but in general it will be decoupled from it (as it makes the rules
    easier to manage over time). There are no technical limitations on using
    your domain model as your fact model, however this introduces tighter
    coupling between your business domain (domain model) and your knowledge
    domain (fact model). Consequentially if your domain model were to change
    you would need to, at the very least, revisit your rule
    definitions.</para>

      <title>Ways to define a Fact Model</title>

      <para>There are two ways to do define your fact model; each of which
      will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Upload a JAR file containing Java Classes used by both your
          application and rules.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Declare a model within Guvnor; that can be exported as a
          KnowledgeBase and used within your Java code.</para>
