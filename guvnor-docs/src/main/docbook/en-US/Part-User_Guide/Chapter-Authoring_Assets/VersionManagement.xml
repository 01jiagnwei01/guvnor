    <title>Version management</title>

    <para>Both assets and whole packages of assets are "versioned" in the
    Guvnor, but the mechanism is slightly different. Individual assets are
    saved a bit like a version of a file in a source control system. However,
    packages of assets are versioned "on demand" by taking a snapshot
    (typically which is used for deployment). The next section talks about
    deployment management and snapshots.</para>

    <para>Each time you make a change to an asset, it creates a new item in
    the version history. This is a bit like having an unlimited undo. You can
    look back through the history of an individual asset like the list above,
    and view it (and restore it) from that point in time.</para>
